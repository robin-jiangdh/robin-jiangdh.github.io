Typically it's something like <code class="code" id="c409482d_493">tenant_id</code></p></li><li class="list__item" id="c409482d_494"><p>Next column is more cardinal, less important. It can be rounded time sometimes, or <code class="code" id="c409482d_495">site_id</code>, or <code class="code" id="c409482d_496">source_id</code>, or <code class="code" id="c409482d_497">group_id</code> or something similar.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="c409482d_498"><p>repeat p.3 once again (or few times)</p></li><li class="list__item" id="c409482d_499"><p>if you added already all columns important for filtering and you still not addressing a single row with you pk - you can add more columns which can help to put similar records close to each other (to improve the compression)</p></li><li class="list__item" id="c409482d_500"><p>if you have something like hierarchy / tree-like relations between the columns - put there the records from 'root' to 'leaves' for example (continent, country, cityname). This way clickhouse can do lookup by country / city even if continent is not specified (it will just 'check all continents') special variants of MergeTree may require special ORDER BY to make the record unique etc.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="c409482d_501"><p>For timeseries it usually make sense to put timestamp as latest column in ORDER BY, it helps with putting the same data near by for better locality. There is only 2 major patterns for timestamps in ORDER BY: (..., toStartOf(Day|Hour|...)(timestamp), ..., timestamp) and (..., timestamp). First one is useful when your often query small part of table partition. (table partitioned by months and your read only 1-4 days 90% of times)</p></li></ol><p id="c409482d_502">Some examples or good order by</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="none"         >
