id="9fa38fa9_610">order by</code> usually have 3 to 5 columns, from lowest cardinal on the left (and the most important for filtering) to highest cardinal (and less important for filtering).</p><p id="9fa38fa9_611">Practical approach to create an good ORDER BY for a table:</p><ol class="list _decimal" id="9fa38fa9_612" type="1"><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_613"><p>Pick the columns you use in filtering always</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_614"><p>The most important for filtering and the lowest cardinal should be the left-most. Typically it's something like <code class="code" id="9fa38fa9_615">tenant_id</code></p></li><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_616"><p>Next column is more cardinal, less important. It can be rounded time sometimes, or <code class="code" id="9fa38fa9_617">site_id</code>, or <code class="code" id="9fa38fa9_618">source_id</code>, or <code class="code" id="9fa38fa9_619">group_id</code> or something similar.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_620"><p>repeat p.3 once again (or few times)</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_621"><p>if you added already all columns important for filtering and you still not addressing a single row with you pk - you can add more columns which can help to put similar records close to each other (to improve the compression)</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_622"><p>if you have something like hierarchy / tree-like relations between the columns - put there the records from 'root' to 'leaves' for example (continent, country, cityname). This way clickhouse can do lookup by country / city even if continent is not specified (it will just 'check all continents') special variants of MergeTree may require special ORDER BY to make the record unique etc.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9fa38fa9_623"><p>For timeseries it usually make sense to put timestamp as latest column in ORDER BY, it helps with putting the same data near by for better locality. There is only 2 major patterns for timestamps in ORDER BY: (..., toStartOf(Day|Hour|...)(timestamp), ..., timestamp) and (..., timestamp). First one is useful when your often query small part of table partition. (table partitioned by months and your read only 1-4 days 90% of times)</p></li></ol><p id="9fa38fa9_624">Some examples or good order by</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="none"         >

ORDER BY (tenant_id, hour, country_code, team_id, group_id, source_id)

</div></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="for-replacing-collapsing" data-toc="for-replacing-collapsing"   >For Replacing / Collapsing</h3><p id="9fa38fa9_632">You need to keep all 'mutable' columns outside of ORDER BY, and have some unique id (a base to collapse duplicates) inside. Typically the right-most column is some row identifier. And it's often not needed in sparse index (so PRIMARY KEY can be a prefix of ORDER BY) The rest consideration are the same.</p><p id="9fa38fa9_633">Examples:</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="none"         >
ORDER BY (tenantid, site_id, eventid) --  utm_source is mutable, while tenantid, site_id is not
PRIMARY KEY (tenantid, site_id) -- eventid is not used for filtering, needed only for collapsing duplicates
